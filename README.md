### 🧭 About Me

I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic, where I lead Data and AI infrastructure initiatives. Previously, I led platform engineering at Wealthfront and built large-scale, privacy-aware data systems at Facebook. My focus spans distributed systems, data platforms, and building empowered engineering teams.

I'm a proud **Senior Member of IEEE**, and an active member of both the **British Computer Society (BCS)** and **Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)** — committed to advancing technology, upholding engineering ethics, and contributing to global tech communities.
